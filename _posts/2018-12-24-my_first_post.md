<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello everyone! I am in the middle of applying for my PhD, and have been spending some time reflecting on my path thus far as well as my hopes for the future. What I've come to appreciate is the great number of people who have helped me along the way and played a huge part in my career thus far.</p>

I also noted that the first experience that seriously caused me to consider a career doing research was an internship I had in high school in a lab at the University of Pennsylvania[^1]. I got the sense of what a scientist actually does day-to-day, and could actually see myself doing that in the future.

Considering these two thoughts, I'd like to present my two main goals for this blog:

__1.__ Sharing some of what I've learned from my mentors. I also want to share advice on how to find mentors and create a support network for yourself.

__2.__ Talking about my own experiences, which I hope will be a window into the daily life of a scientist/PhD student/beyond. I hope to include both the fun times and tricky obstacles!

I might also write some posts about my interests or thoughts outside of science if the mood strikes. I'll also give updates on my research, since that of course is an important part of my life as scentist.

Hope you find something worth reading!
